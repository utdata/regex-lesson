        "1. We know that the first line starts at the beginning of the line, so we can start with this token, which signifies that: `^`\n",
        "1. Now, in the end, we don't want to keep the double-quote, so we won't put it inside a group. We'll just add it to the pattern: `^\"`\n",
        "    - Take note of the number of matches at the top right: There are 325 matches, and that is how many records we should end up with. You'll want to keep referring back to that and making sure you have 325 groups.\n",

But here's the drive-you-crazy thing: Windows and Macs treat these differently. On a Mac, `\\n` is a \"new line\". If you are on a Windows machine, you'll need to use `\\R`. The regex101 editor will recognize either, but later when we do the search and replace in your code editor, you have to use the character that works with your operating system. I use a Mac, so: `^\"(.*)\\n`.\n",

        "Then inside the group we'll put a token that looks for word characters:  ^\"(.*)\\n(\\w).\n",
        "Then we'll add the quantifier + to find \"one or more\" of what's in the character set:   ^\"(.*)\\n(\\w+).\n",

        "Capturing the state\n",
        "These are all the same, all in TX, so we don't really have to save it at all, but we will. We'll use this to remind ourselves that you can also just match a string literally. First we put the comma and space outside the second group, since we don't want to keep it:    ^\"(.*)\\n(\\w+), .\n",
        "Catching errors\n",
        "Now, take a moment and check how many matching groups we have. Wait ... WHOA ... we have only 314. What could've gone wrong?\n",

This happens a lot  … we need to back up and fix the error.\n",
        "Right now, our expression is this: ^\"(.*)\\n(\\w+),  and the part that captures the city is (\\w+). We need to use something called a \"character set\"  that allows us to include more than one token within a group. We signify this by putting what we want inside of square brackets: So we need to put the \\w inside square brackets along with the space so we can catch both: ^\"(.*)\\n([\\w ]+), .\n",
        "Back to the state\n",
        "Then we create our third group with TX inside it:   ^\"(.*)\\n([\\w ]+), (TX). We are looking for the literal text TX because there are no other states in this data set. We can't skip it because we need the pattern to continue.\n",

        "Again, we don't want to keep the space between the state and ZIP, so we'll put it outside the third group, and start our fourth one for ZIP: ^\"(.*)\\n([\\w ]+), (TX) ().\n",
        "All of these zip codes are of the 5-digit variety, so this can be less complicated than it might be with 9-digit ZIPs. Again, there are many ways to do this, but we'll use \\d for the numbers and * to capture zero or more of them: ^\"(.*)\\n([\\w ]+), (TX) (\\d*).\n",
        "Complete the pattern for this line with the new line token: ^\"(.*)\\n([\\w ]+), (TX) (\\d*)\\n.\n",

        "Capturing latitude\n",
        "We don't want to keep the parenthesis that starts this last line, so we'll put it outside a group. However, since parenthesis mean something special in regex, we need to escape it with a backslash so it will find the character and not start the new group: ^\"(.*)\\n([\\w ]+), (TX) (\\d*)\\n\\(. Code completion might make this tricky, but you can do it!\n",
        "Now we can start our new group, so go ahead and add the beginning and end parentheses: ^\"(.*)\\n([\\w ]+), (TX) (\\d*)\\n\\(().\n",
        "Inside our fifth group, we need numbers and the decimal point. We will create a character set using square brackets and put inside it \\d for numbers and \\. for the decimal point, which we have to escape since . means \"any character\". We finish it off by using + to look for one or more of the characters in the set. Like this:\n",

        "Capturing longitude\n",

        "We can get the longitude like we did latitude, but we have to add the hyphen to the character set. So, create the group:\n",
        "^\"(.*)\\n([\\w ]+), (TX) (\\d*)\\n\\(([\\d\\.]+), ().\n",
        "Add the character set:\n",
        "^\"(.*)\\n([\\w ]+), (TX) (\\d*)\\n\\(([\\d\\.]+), ([]).\n",

        "Because the trailing parentheses and quote are at the end of a line, we could ignore them, but we won't. We'll add them to the end of the pattern, escaping the close parentheses just to be sure:\n",

        "A quick refresher from our intro: Once we've built a group, we can reference it in our substitution string by order in which we captured it. So, if we want to reference our first group, we use this: $1. Put that in the SUBSTITUTION string box, like this:\n",
