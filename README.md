This repo has the companion data for my lecture [Wrangling data with Regular Expressions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DvAM4lnGJLefo9skD8GgM-_9S1BEhpjJfV86yhJavI0/edit).

That lesson uses this data fele: [socrata_addresses.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/utdata/regex-lesson/master/socrata_addresses.txt)

I've started a backup version of this lesson that uses only VS Code and no internet, but it is incomplete.
